## Guide of Installation

- In the first execuion the program is going to create some files and directories that will be needed and the uses will have to manualy change such as the **Api-keys** and **FileID**.

- The current api for the json is [Json Bin](https://jsonbin.io/) that will be using the Api-key, the user will need to provide its own Api-key that is found in [Api-keys Json Bin](https://jsonbin.io/app/app/api-keys) and paste it in the file **_data/api-keys/JSONBINKEY_**.

- After placing the key in the file user must create a new json in [Json Bin Files](https://jsonbin.io/app/bins) placing this as its content **{"date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
  "todo": [{"task": "","status": "Not completed"}]}**.

- Then the user has to copy the **FileID** labeled as **_Bin Id_** and paste it in **_data/api-keys/FileID_**.

    - Then run again the program and everything should work as expected.
